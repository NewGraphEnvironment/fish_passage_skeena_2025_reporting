# Pre-Processing Inputs

Workflows for pre-processing of field data so it aligns with our reporting and fits the requirements for PSCIS uploads.

These are often two-way workflows where we use output CSV spreadsheets to update our raw input datasheets through a manual copy-paste-special. 

These are designed to be self-sufficient scripts with everything in them necessary to do their specific task with a clean working environment.
